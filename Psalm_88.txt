Psalm 88, a song of the Sons of Korah, is one of the rare lamentation Psalms in the Biblical Psalms book from the Old Testament. It is traditionally attributed to Heman the Ezrahite, a wise man mentioned in 1 Kings 4:31, suggesting an ancient Israelite origin. This psalm stands out for its deep sense of despair and absence of resolution, unlike most Psalms which generally conclude with consolation or praise. Given the themes of darkness, suffering, and abandonment, some scholars infer that the psalm might have been used in ancient rituals for the sick or dying. Thus, Psalm 88 provides significant insights into the cultural and theological perspectives on suffering in the ancient Israelite community.
