1. Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
2. Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
3. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
4. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
5. Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it will be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
6. When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
7. Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
8. But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
9. Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.Main Point 1: The Psalmist's plea for God's presence and protection.

In this light, the attributes of God as seen in Psalm 141 include heeding the words and prayers of the faithful, discernment of actions, divine protection from being led astray or following the wrong path, and destructive forces or sinful influences.

1. Divine responsiveness: The Psalmist begins this Psalm by requesting God to heed his call, "O Lord, I call to you; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you" (Psalm 141:1). This highlights God's attribute of being sensitive and responsive to the prayers and calls of His faithful ones.

2. Judge and Discerner: Verse 4 mentions, "Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers". Here, God is depicted as one who knows the hearts and minds of people, having the ability to steer hearts from evil influences.

3. Protector: The Psalmist also regards God as a protector, one who keeps Him from falling into the traps of wickedness or from the snares of evil people, "Keep me safe, LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent, who devise ways to trip my feet" (Psalm 141:4). God is seen as one who provides refuge and protection to His people from harm and evil paths.

4. Lord of Justice: This Psalm also points to God as one who brings justice and punishment to the wicked, as indicated in verse 5, "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety."

These attributes present a God who is attentive, who listens and responds to prayers, who discerns the hearts of people and protects them from evil, and who is just and fair in dealing with the wicked and wrongdoers. God, as presented in this Psalm, seems not disconnected and distant but quite involved and invested in the lives of His believers.

The Psalm also reflects a longing for the fellowship of God, as seen in the appeal for God to regard his prayers as incense and the lifting of hands as an evening sacrifice (Psalm 141:2), presenting God as a fellowship-loving Father who enjoys communing with His children.Psalm 141 can be seen as a passionate plea for purity, vigilance, and reliance on God that harmonizes with themes found in the teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles. The themes such as self-examination, controlling the tongue, the way to prayer, and watchfulness against evil echo the teachings of Jesus and were later reiterated by the apostles.

Psalm 141 starts with Lord being the center of the prayer,"I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you." This resonates with Jesus' teaching on prayer in Matthew 6:6, "But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen."

In verses 3-4 of Psalm 141, the psalmist prays for help in being mindful of his words and heart, "Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds." 

Jesus Christ emphasizes the relation between heart and speech in Matthew 12:34, "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of," a teaching that is later supported by apostle James' teachings on taming the tongue, James 3: 5-6, "Similarly, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body."

In Psalms 141:5, the psalmist prays for correction and accepts rebuke, this aligns with Christ's teachings on humility and correction and is further expressed by Apostles like Paul in 2 Timothy 3:16, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness," and Peter in 1 Peter 5:5, "All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” 

Psalm 141:8 says, "But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge..." This theme of divine refuge and protection is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, such as we can see in John 16:33, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world," and carried forward by the apostles such as in Paul's words in Philippians 4:7, "And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

Essentially, the psalm engages a framework of self-examination, controlling the tongue, prayer, and divine refuge which resonates with the teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles.While there isn't a direct, exact parallel to Psalm 141, there are several psalms that share similar themes or patterns.
