Psalm 12 belongs to the biblical book of Psalms in the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to King David. It is a lament for the disappearance of righteousness and faithfulness among men and a cry for divine intervention. The psalm reflects a tumultuous period in Israel's history when societal morals were falling, extolling the Lord's intervention in promise to protect the poor and needy. Cultural norms of the time are echoed in the text with allegorical implications such as the purification of silver, representing the righteousness of God's promises. Psalm 12 provides a valuable insight into the societal turbulence of the period and the fervent religious belief in divine intervention for the oppressed.1. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.

2. They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

3. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:

4. Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.

6. The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

7. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.Main Point 1: God’s Protection in Times of Trouble

Psalm 12 depicts God as a protector and deliverer who values truth and righteousness. Several divine attributes emerge in this Psalm:

1. God as Protector: The Psalmist pleads with God to come for their aid since the godly and faithful have ceased to exist (verse 1). This plea demonstrates faith in God's protective capacity. 

2. God as Deliverer and Savior: In verse 5, God's divine attribute as a deliverer is expressed. When the Psalmist cries about the oppression of the poor, God responds, pledging to provide safety and save the afflicted. 

3. God as Truth: The words of the Lord are depicted as pure words, as silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times (verse 6). This metaphor underlines God's truth and the purity of his promises, establishing His divine attribute of truthfulness and reliability.

4. God as a Preserver: In Verse 7, God is seen as the Preserver. "O Lord, you will keep us; you will preserve us from this generation forever,"  emphasising the belief in God's enduring protection and care despite the changing times.

5. The Incomparability of God: In this Psalm, God's divine qualities are contrasted with the vanities of “the children of man” (verses 2). The people are portrayed as deceitful and manipulative, with 'double hearts,' which strongly contrasts with the purity and integrity of God.

6. God as Righteous: The Psalm describes God as a righteous judge. The wicked roam around when the vileness of human beings is exalted (verse 8), showing how God stands against vileness and upholds righteousness.

7. God as Sovereign: There's an undertone in Psalm 12 that glorifies God's surpassing authority and sovereignty. Despite the dominance of the wicked, God's words and actions are final and superseding.

Similar divine attributes are professed across religious scripts where God is often seen as the savior, protector, purveyor of justice, truth, and the ultimate authority, indicating an universal yearning for a divine presence that exhibits these attributes in the face of human frailty.Psalm 12 is a plea for help in evil times, where David laments the wickedness that surrounds him, characterised by deceitful and boastful words. This theme resonates throughout the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles in their stress on truthfulness, humility and reliance on God's deliverance.

1) Deceitfulness vs Truth: In verses 1-2 of Psalm 12, David speaks of the deceitful language prevailing among his people. This resonates with Jesus Christ’s teachings about speaking truth. In John 14:6, Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Additionally, in Matthew 15:18-20, Jesus explains that our words reveal the condition of our hearts, emphasising the power of truthful speech over deceitful words.

2) Boastfulness vs Humility: In Psalm 12:3-4, David mentions the boastful tongues, which the Lord will cut off. The New Testament, particularly within the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles, contains strong messages against pride and boasting. Jesus said, "For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted" (Luke 14:11). Also, the Apostle Peter reminds us in 1 Peter 5:5, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."

3) God’s words are pure: Psalm 12:6 describes God's words as pure, a silver refined in a furnace, symbolising the trustworthiness of God's promises. This idea resonates in the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 24:35, where He says, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."

4) God will keep his people safe: David’s confidence in God’s protection in Psalm 12:7 is reflected in Jesus' teachings. In John 10:28, Jesus assures, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand." This parallels David's trust in God's protection of the 'righteous' in the midst of 'wickedness.'

5) Lack of godly people: Psalm 12 begins with David bemoaning the absence of godly people. This theme is echoed in the New Testament where Jesus and His Apostles also express concerns about wavering faith and spiritual weakness among the people. For instance, in Luke 18:8, Jesus questions, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"

These connections highlight the consistent Biblical message of truthfulness, humility, trust in the immutable word of God, assurance in God’s deliverance, and the challenge of maintaining faith in difficult times. These enduring themes link Psalm 12 with the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles, showing the interconnectedness of the Bible's message.The psalms are a collection of religious verses, each with its own unique message and tone. No psalm is entirely identical to another, including Psalm 12. However, certain psalms share thematic similarities with Psalm 12. Here are a few examples:

1. Psalm 10: This Psalm is similar to Psalm 12 in its lament about wickedness and the seeming triumph of evil men. Both imply a yearning for divine intervention to aid the righteous who are oppressed. 

2. Psalm 14 and Psalm 53: These Psalms are almost identical to each other and share a common theme with Psalm 12 - they describe widespread corruption among people and a cry for God's intervention.

3. Psalm 11: It shares a similar theme with Psalm 12 where the psalmist exclaims his trust in God amidst the evil actions of wicked people.

4. Psalm 64: Like Psalm 12, this psalm serves as a prayer for protection against wickedness and evil. Both Psalms depict the malicious acts of the wicked and pray for divine intervention.

5. Psalm 140: This Psalm, like Psalm 12, contains a plea for deliverance from persecutors and is grouped in the section called "Prayers for deliverance from enemies".

These Psalms are not identical to Psalm 12 in terms of composition or language, but they do share similar themes of lamenting the wicked and praying for divine intervention or deliverance. It's also important to note that each of the Psalms have different structures, use different poetic devices and serve different ritual purposes thus they are all unique and crafted specifically for different instances.Without the specific context of a study guide, it's impossible to provide the answers you're looking for.
