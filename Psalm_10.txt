Psalm 10 is a part of the biblical Hebrew Psalter, a collection of 150 poetic religious texts part of the Old Testament in most Christian bible translations and in the Jewish Tanakh. Recognized as a lament Psalm, it addresses feelings of despair as the Psalmist questions God’s seeming absence during times of trouble. The composition date of Psalm 10 is uncertain, although it is thought to have arisen during a period of significant trouble for the Israelites. The Psalm provides a dramatic portrayal of wicked people triumphing, emphasizing the gap between the righteous and the wicked that was often a point of intense reflection for the ancient Israelites. Its primary context would have been in public worship and private devotion, wherein the text was used for its emotive and spiritual impact.Psalm 10

1 Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? 
why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?

2 The wicked in his pride doth persecive the poor: 
let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, 
and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.

4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: 
God is not in all his thoughts.

5 His ways are always grievous; 
thy judgments are far above out of his sight: 
as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: 
for I shall never be in adversity.

7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: 
under his tongue is mischief and vanity.

8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: 
in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: 
his eyes are privily set against the poor.

9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: 
he lieth in wait to catch the poor: 
he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.

10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, 
that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: 
he hideth his face; he will never see it.

12 Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: 
forget not the humble.

13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? 
he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.

14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, 
to requite it with thy hand: 
the poor committeth himself unto thee; 
thou art the helper of the fatherless.

15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: 
seek out his wickedness till thou find none.

16 The Lord is King for ever and ever: 
the heathen are perished out of his land.

17 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: 
thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, 
that the man of the earth may no more oppress.Main point 1: Lament over Wickedness

This Psalm begins by questioning God's apparent distance in or absence during times of great need or trouble. However, it ultimately confirms the following attributes of God:

1. Omnipresence: Despite seeming distant, Psalm 10 portrays God as being present at all times. This is evident when the Psalmist in verse 1 asks, "Why, O Lord, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?" The Psalmist here implies that he understands God is always present, yet feels a sense of distance, perhaps due to the difficulties he is experiencing.

2. Righteousness: The Psalmist depicts God as righteous and just. In verse 2 to 11, the Psalmist describes the wicked deeds of the wicked people which he believes will not escape God's righteousness. In verses 14-15, he implores God to deliver justice on behalf of the helpless and the oppressed.

3. Omnipotence: God's omnipotence is revealed in verse 14 where the Psalmist says, "But you do see; indeed you note trouble and grief, that you may take it into your hands; the helpless commit themselves to you; you have been the helper of the orphan."This highlights God's ability to take control of all situations.

4. Benevolence: Despite the description of hardship and wickedness in the world, the Psalmist still believes in God's goodness. In verse 14, he writes, "But you God see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless." The Psalmist is imploring on God's benevolence to act mercifully towards the afflicted.

5. Executor of Justice: Here, God is described as the ultimate judge, who takes action against evil (v.15): "Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out."

6. Eternal: The Psalmist affirms that God is eternal, repeating the age-old affirmation in verse 16 by saying, "The LORD is King forever and ever...".

7. Protector: In verses 17-18, the Psalmist shows that God hears the desire of the humble, encourages them, and listens to their cry, showing God as their protector.

While these attributes may be similar to many other portions in the Bible, Psalm 10 exposes them within the frame of suffering, injustice, and human agony. It shows a God who is not distant but attentive to such situations, demonstrating His justice, righteousness, and protective nature in human affairs for the glory of His eternal reign.Psalm 10 is a lamentation about the wicked and a prayer for vindication. It unfolds despair in the prevailing wickedness of men and calls for God's justice. Also, it conveys a profound truth about God's justice and faithfulness. The psalm can also be seen resonating with the teachings and life of Jesus Christ and His apostles.

1. The Universality of Sin: Psalm 10:2-4 describes the wickedness of people who are arrogant and believe there is no God, which resonates with the teachings of Jesus and His apostles about the universality of sin. Romans 3:23 states, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." The understanding of the inherent sinfulness of man is a fundamental concept in Christian thought.

2. The Absence of God in the Wicked: Psalm 10:4 says, “In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God." This verse reflects the reality that sin separates us from God, a concept taught by Jesus and His apostles. Jesus states in Mark 7:21-23, "For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder..."

3. The Need for Divine Intervention: Psalm 10 pleads for God to intervene, an idea consistent with the teachings of Jesus and His apostles. It is only through God's intervention that humanity can be saved. Jesus’s primary mission on earth was a divine intervention to save humanity. He states in Luke 19:10, "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."

4. Reward/Punishment and Justice: Psalm 10:14-16 points toward a God of justice who hears the cries of the innocent, sees their troubles, and promises justice. This is echoed in Jesus' teachings from Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled."

5. Dependence on God: The psalmist shows a complete dependence on God (Psalm 10:17). Similarly, Jesus instructed His disciples to depend on God for everything in their lives. Matthew 6:33 states, “But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”

6. Comforting the Oppressed: Psalm 10 describes God as one who comforts the oppressed and defends the fatherless and the oppressed, ensuring that earthly terror no longer becomes a fear for them. Jesus also exhibited this trait through His ministry where He provided comfort and solace to the oppressed. Jesus, in Matthew 11:28, said: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."

7. The Dominion of God: Psalm 10:16 says, "The LORD is King forever and ever." This is reiterated by the apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 1:17, "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."

Thus, Psalm 10 resonates profoundly with the teachings of Christ and His apostles, underlying the universality of sin, the need for divine salvation, the promise of divine justice, the importance of dependence on God, His comforting nature, and His eternal reign.After an extensive search in biblical literature, there are no psalms identical to Psalm 10.
