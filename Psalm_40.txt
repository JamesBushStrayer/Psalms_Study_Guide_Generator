1. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

2. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

3. And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

4. Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

5. Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

7. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,

8. I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

10. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

11. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

12. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth me.

13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

15. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

16. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

It also reveals His innumerableness and complexity, and His concerns and care for the poor and the needy.

1. God as Faithful and Trustworthy: Throughout this Psalm, David mentions how he waited patiently for the Lord, and God turned to him and heard his cry (verse 1). This particular verse shows how God is faithful and promptly reaches out to His children in their time of need. Furthermore, the Psalmist has experienced the Lord's faithfulness, so he eagerly waits on the Lord with confidence.

2. The Love and Righteousness of God: God’s actions are driven by His love and righteousness. He works in the lives of those who place their trust in Him, not because of who they are but because of His unfailing love and righteousness. This Psalm reveals that love and righteousness are always linked in God's actions.

3. God as Saviour: Verses 2-3 portrays God as a savior that pulls His believers out of a horrible pit, sets their feet upon a rock, and gives them a new song. This shows His power to rescue and redeem from desperate situations and then provide stability and joy, comfort and security.

4. God as Comforter and Helper: David articulates how God cares for His people by being a helper and protecting them. God wants to be engaged in the difficulties we encounter, and He is very willing and capable of giving aid to His faithful followers. Verse 17 says “you are my help and my deliverer”, a testament to God as our ultimate source of help and deliverance.

5. God’s Innumerableness and Complexity: In verse 5, David exclaims, "Many, LORD my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare." This highlights God's innumerable works and plans, His infinite power and wisdom beyond our understanding.

6. God’s Concern and Care for the Poor and Needy: God consistently sides with the poor and those without power. In the final verse of the Psalm, David writes (40:17), "But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay." David calls upon God’s attribute of compassion, demonstrating that God has a heart for the weak and the poor, and He is always there to provide help when we are in need.

All these attributes of God in Psalm 40 paints a clear picture of who God is – a faith-filled, loving, righteous, saving, helping, infinite, complex, and caring God who delights in deliverance, answers prayers chooses faithfulness, and upholds justice for the poor and the needy. These attributes define God’s self-less, infinite, and perfect nature. Through studying and meditating on Psalm 40, believers can understand God’s nature more deeply, and therefore grow more confident and comforted in their faith journey.Psalm 40 is a reflection of faithful waiting, divine deliverance, and steadfast obedience. It has its reverberation in the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. Let's analyze the key connections.

1) A Heart of Obedience: The Psalmist David states in Psalm 40:8, "I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart." This foreshadows Christ's obedience to God's will throughout His earthly ministry. This is explicitly reflected in John 4:34 when Jesus says, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work."

2) Faithful Waiting: Psalm 40:1-2 states, "I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry. He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure." This idea of patiently waiting and trusting in God's deliverance is central to Jesus' teachings. For example, in Luke 12:36, Jesus tells His disciples, "and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master."

3) Public Declaration of God's Works: The Psalmist says in Psalm 40:9-10, "I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O LORD. I have not hidden your saving help within my heart, I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation." This aligns with Christ's Great Commission given in Matthew 28:19-20 where He instructs His Apostles to spread the good news of His salvation.

4) Humility and Thanksgiving: In Psalm 40:4, we read, "Blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods." This theme of humility and faithfulness resonates with Jesus' teaching in Matthew 5:3, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

5) Suffering and Deliverance: Psalm 40:17 states, "As for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay." This resonates with the teaching of Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:9, "But He said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'" Paul, like David, acknowledges his neediness and finds his strength in divine deliverance.

6) Prophecy of Christ’s Sacrifice: Psalm 40:6-8 may be considered a prophetic description of Christ's sacrifice: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire...Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required”. Then I said, 'Behold, I come...to do Your will, O God.” This is mirrored in Hebrews 10:5-7, where the writer quotes this Psalm and applies it to Jesus Christ coming into the world to do God's will, not by animal sacrifices, but by offering Himself.

In conclusion, Psalm 40 echoes the themes of patience in waiting, obedience to God's will, trust in divine providence, acknowledgement of own weaknesses, and sacrifice for God's purpose which are central to the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. These connections deepen our understanding of the continuity of God's message across the Scripture.Psalm 70 is the psalm that is highly similar to Psalm 40, specifically Psalm 40:13-17. Here's a detailed comparison:

Psalm 40:13-17:
13 Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
14 May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
15 May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" be appalled at their own shame.
16 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, "The Lord is great!"
17 But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.

The entire Psalm 70:
1 Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
2 May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
3 May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" turn back because of their shame.
4 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, "The Lord is great!"
5 But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.

Looking at these two parts of scripture, it is clear that Psalm 70 is nearly identical to Psalm 40:13-17. The major themes are the same: a plea for help from God, a desire for the enemies to be turned away in their ill intentions, a call for those who seek God to rejoice, and a humble acknowledgement of the speaker’s lowly state and need for God. While the exact wording differs slightly in some places, the idea and structure conveyed are almost exactly the same. Both end with a poignant plea to God not to delay in coming to the speaker’s aid, reinforcing the sense of urgency and need that pervades both psalms.As an AI, I will need the exact text of the study guide questions to answer them.
