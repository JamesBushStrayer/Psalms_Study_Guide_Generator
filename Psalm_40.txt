Psalm 40 is a powerful blend of emotion and spirituality, demonstrating a deep connection between a faithful individual and God. It highlights the feeling of despair the psalmist has but also their unquestionable hope in the grace and salvation of God. The spiritual theme revolves around patience and perseverance in times of trials, as waiting for the Lord yields rewarding outcomes. The psalm also promotes active faith and praise as fundamental aspects of spiritual duty. Overall, it is a poetic reflection of endurance in adversity, reliance on divine intervention, and commitment to worship.

Psalm 40 is a profound exploration of spiritual and emotional elements woven intimately within the human experience within God's grace. It touches an array of reflections such as patience in waiting for God's intervention, joy in salvation, ultimate trust in divine power and the conflict of human despair. The intimate acknowledgement of sin and open praise for God's redeeming love in this psalm translates into the overarching narrative of Christian faith. Just like Christ, who embodies salvation, the psalmist’s plea for divine deliverance echoes the Christian journey from despair to hope. By recognizing human frailties and the transformative power of God’s redemption, Psalm 40 fosters within its verses the very essence of Christian faith - salvation through divine love and mercy.

1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
  
2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 

5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.

6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,

8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. 

13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
