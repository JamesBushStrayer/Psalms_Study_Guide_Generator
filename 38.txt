Psalm 38

1. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

2. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities are gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

9. Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

10. My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

12. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

14. Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15. For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

16. For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.

18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19. But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.

21. Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me.

22. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.Psalm 38, a penitential psalm authored by King David, has a deep context rooted in self-awareness, remorse, submission, and plea for divine intervention. The psalm reflects David's self-confession and profound regret over his sins, amalgamated with his physical sufferings. Historically, it is believed that David might have written Psalm 38 during his later years due to his explicit articulation of bodily afflictions and emotional turmoil. Culturally, it is within Jewish tradition to read Psalm 38 during Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, as it encapsulates a repentant spirit yearning for God's mercy and forgiveness. This psalm serves as a profound prayerful scripture, teaching repentance and the importance of divine intervention in times of physical and spiritual distress.Psalm 38

The psalmist acknowledges his sins and seeks the forgiveness and restoration from God. Throughout the Psalm, several attributes of God are subtly etched out. 

1. God as Righteous Judge: The Psalm begins with the supplicant asking God not to rebuke him in his anger nor to discipline him in his wrath. This indirectly highlights God's righteous nature, where He is seen as the fair judge who disciplines and corrects those who stray from His ways.

2. God as Forgiving and Merciful: As the psalmist confesses his sins and pleads for mercy, God's forgiving nature becomes evident. He is the not the one who holds grudges but forgives the iniquities and allows ways for redemption. 

3. God as Healer: There is an intense plea for healing in Psalm 38. In his physical pain and distress, the psalmist looks to God as the divine healer.

4. God as the Omniscient: The psalmist acknowledges that God knows every detail of his condition. This implies God’s trait of being all-knowing or omniscient. 

5. God as Saviour: The Psalmist pleads for salvation from his circumstances. He recognizes that only God can deliver him from his distressful situation.

6. God as a Listener: In his distress, the Psalmist calls out to God, indicating a belief in God’s responsiveness and attentiveness to human pleas.

The similar attributes are seen in many other Psalms and throughout the Bible, where God is depicted as a righteous Judge (Psalm 7:11), a forgiving God (Numbers 14:18), a healer (Psalm 103:3), an omniscient God (Psalms 139:4), a savior (Psalm 68:20), and a Listener (Psalm 116:1-2).Psalm 38 is a lament psalm in which David cries out to God because of his physical and emotional suffering, brought on by his own sins. One can draw connections between David’s repentance and humility here and the teachings of Jesus and his Apostles in the New Testament.

Jesus preached about repentance from sins, just as David does in this Psalm. Matthew 4:17 records Jesus' words: "From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'" This connects with Psalm 38:18 where David says, "I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.”

Similarly, in Luke 5:31-32, Jesus stated, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance." This correlates directly with David's state of mind in Psalm 38:3, "There is no health in my bones because of my sin."

The Apostle Paul also addressed the issues of sin and God's wrath, similar to David's experience in Psalm 38. Romans 6:23 says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." This theme is reflected in Psalm 38:1: "O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, and chasten me not in your hot displeasure."

Following this, Psalm 38 also touches upon themes of suffering and affliction, which are important themes in the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles. For instance, James 5:13 instructs, "Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise." David echoes this sentiment in Psalm 38:9 when he earnestly prays, "O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you."

The Apostle Peter also referred to suffering for righteousness, which David experienced in the Psalm. 1 Peter 3:14 says, "But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled." This mirrors Psalm 38:20: "Those who repay evil for good attack me when I try to do right."

Jesus’ words on the cross in Luke 23:34, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing," can also be seen as connected to Psalm 38. Despite his turmoil and suffering caused by his enemies and also by his own sins, David pleads with God for forgiveness and mercy, just as Jesus does.

In conclusion, there are numerous ways to connect the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles to the themes and sentiments expressed in Psalm 38 that include repentance from sin, suffering and the plea for God’s mercy and divine forgiveness.After thorough investigation, the following Psalm shares thematic similarity with Psalm 38:

Psalm 6: This Psalm, like Psalm 38, is also a penitential psalm. It entails the theme of divine chastisement and plea for deliverance from God's anger. Both psalms represent the psalmist’s cry for mercy, forgiveness, and relief from the painful consequences of his sins. In Psalm 6 verse 1, the psalmist says, "O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath". This directly parallels David's plea in Psalm 38 verse 1: "O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, be not harsh with me in your anger".

While these two Psalms share similar themes, they are not identical and do not have the same wording beyond a common usage of key phrases. In further comparison with other Psalms in the book of Psalms, no Psalm is found to be "identical" or "highly similar" to Psalm 38 in its entirety. Psalms often share common themes of praise, lament, thanksgiving, or penitence, but each one is unique in its expression of these themes.
 
It's important to note that psalms are highly personal and emotional. Each one is crafted to express individual experiences, struggles or moments of joy. They are words that spring from deep within the heart of the psalmist, and so while they may have similarities, they also have their distinct individuality.Without knowing the exact study guide or subject matter, it's impossible to provide an answer.
