Psalm 40 is a psalm from the Book of Psalms, often attributed to King David, found in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible and in the Hebrew Tanakh. This psalm includes both thanksgiving for God's deliverance and lament about personal suffering, possibly during a time of personal or communal crisis. King David, if the attributed author, would have lived in ancient Israel around 1000 BCE, a culture deeply entwined with the religious beliefs and practices dictated in the Hebrew Bible. It describes a personal experience of deliverance and testifies to the mercy and salvation from the Lord, making it often used for encouragement during hardships. Understanding its historical and cultural context is key to interpreting its messages of faith, patience, and reliance on God's deliverance.**Psalm 40**

1. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
2. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
3. And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
4. Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
5. Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
 
6. Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
7. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
8. I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
10. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

11. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
12. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth me.
13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
15. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

16. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. 
17. But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.Main Point 1: David's Gratitude and Trust in God

1. God's Deliverance: The Psalm starts with the experience of deliverance where the psalmist experiences God pulling him from a dangerous pit and setting him on a solid place (verses 1-2). 

2. God's Reliability and Stability: This is emphasized where God sets the Psalmist's feet on a rock, making his steps secure (verse 2). Often, a rock in the Bible signifies stability, dependability, and permanence.

3. God's Creativity: God puts a new song in the Psalmist's mouth to sing (verse 3). This represents the creativity, refreshment, and renewal that is part of God's character. 

4. God's Wondrous Deeds: The Psalmist speaks of the many wonderful things that God has done, which no one can compare to (verse 5).  

5. God's Righteousness and Faithfulness: The Psalmist talks about God's righteousness and faithfulness, stating that God does not withhold his merciful love and truth from him (verse 11). 

6. God's Sovereignty: God has a divine plan; these plans may not be known to humans, but they're constantly at play (verse 5). 

7. God's Love and Mercy: The Psalmist talks about the greatness of God’s steadfast love (verse 11). 

8. God's Willingness to Listen: This is seen where God opens ears allowing us to perceive and understand His truth (verse 6).

In terms of similarities, divine attributes expressed in Psalm 40 are consistent with the rest of the Scripture:

1. Deliverance: God's role as a deliverer is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the Exodus story where He delivers the Israelites from Egypt.

2. Righteousness/Faithfulness: God's righteousness and faithfulness are also recurring themes. For instance, in Psalm 36:6 and Deuteronomy 32:4.

3. Love and Mercy: God's love and mercy are central to His character, as evident in both the Old and New Testaments - Psalm 86:15, John 3:16, and Ephesians 2:4-5, for instance.

4. Sovereignty: The sovereignty of God is evident throughout the Bible, an example being Psalm 115:3, which emphatically states that "Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases."

This resonates with Christians and followers of Abrahamic religions as they see God not only as a divine deity but also as a loving, protective, just, creative, dependable, and personal savior who they can trust during the highs and lows of life.Psalm 40 is a deeply significant Psalm that speaks of faith in challenging circumstances, God's deliverance, faithfulness to His promises, obedience to His will, and the importance of bearing witness to God's salvific acts. These themes resonate deeply with the person and teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles.

1. Waiting In Faith: Psalm 40:1-2 starts with the psalmist, David, waiting patiently for the Lord. He affirms his faith in God's time of deliverance. It parallels with Jesus' teaching on persistent faith and prayer as seen in Luke 18:1-8, where he encourages the disciples to always pray and never give up. It also mirrors the patience of Christ Himself, as He waited for His appointed time to offer Himself for mankind's salvation (Galatians 4:4-5). 

2. Divine Deliverance: In verses 2 and 3, David describes how God rescued him from trouble and put a new song in his mouth. Similarly, Jesus Christ, through his death and resurrection, delivers humanity from sin and death, offering a new life in Him (Romans 6:4). The Apostles echo this theme of deliverance in their teachings (Acts 26:18). 

3. Faithfulness to God’s Law: In Psalm 40:8, David proclaims delight in doing God's will and upholding His law. Jesus also showed His commitment to the law of God, not to abolish but fulfill it (Matthew 5:17). The Apostles, too, spoke of the importance of obeying God's will (1 John 2:17)

4. Bearing witness to God’s Acts: Psalm 40:9-10 talks about declaring God's faithfulness, righteousness, and salvation. This can be associated with Christ's mission to proclaim God's kingdom (Luke 4:43) and the apostles' commission to spread the Gospel (Matthew 28:19-20).

5. A Foreshadowing of Christ’s Sacrifice: Lastly, Hebrews 10:5-7 quotes Psalm 40:6-8 as a prophecy fulfilled in Christ, highlighting His willingness to sacrifice His body for humanity's redemption, signifying that He was the ultimate sacrificial offering pleasing to God.

In essence, Psalm 40 resonates deeply with the life and teachings of Jesus and His Apostles in its themes of faith in adversity, deliverance by God, obedience to God's law, witness to God's saving action, and the prophetic significance of Christ's sacrifice.While there are themes and verses throughout the Psalms that might be similar to the ideas expressed in Psalm 40, only one psalm is considered to be highly similar or essentially identical in part. This Psalms is:

1. Psalm 70: Psalm 70 is essentially identical to the last five verses of Psalm 40 (verses 13-17). Both psalms are pleas for God's deliverance and a lament of the psalmist's enemies who seek his downfall. 

In both, the psalmist exhorts God to "Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, LORD, to help me" (Psalm 70:1, Psalm 40:13). The psalmist goes on to ask for his enemies to be "put to shame and confusion" and for those seeking his life to "be turned back in disgrace" (Psalm 70:2, Psalm 40:14). He also prays for those who say, "Aha! Aha!" to be appalled at their own humiliation (Psalm 70:3, Psalm 40:15).

Similar to Psalm 40, Psalm 70 additionally includes a portrayal of the psalmist's trust in God despite his trials, his acknowledgement of his weakness and need for God's help, and his affirmation of God's saving, gracious action. 

In conclusion, while there are recurring themes throughout the Psalms, Psalm 70 is considerably identical to the last part of Psalm 40, making it a remarkable example of the textual similarities within the Psalms.As an AI model, I don't have access to a specific study guide or understanding questions from a particular course or text.
