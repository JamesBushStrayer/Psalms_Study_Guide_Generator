Psalm 35 is a text from the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, attributed to King David, a central figure in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. The psalm is a complex mix of petition, lament, and the expression of trust in God. It reflects a period in history marked by tribal conflict and warfare, revealed in its plea for divine intervention against enemies. David's use of vivid metaphors, such as a warrior, lion, and net, highlights the pervasive cultural symbolism of the era. This psalm is invaluable for reckoning the grand narrative of faith, revealing both the raw human emotion in times of hardship and unwavering trust in divine justice, peculiar to this ancient theistic tradition.Psalm 35 - King James Version

1: Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
   
2: Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
  
3: Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
     
4: Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
     
5: Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord chase them.
    
6: Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
    
7: For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.
    
8: Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
    
9: And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
   
10: All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
   
11: False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
    
12: They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
   
13: But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
    
14: I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
   
15: But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
    
16: With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
    
17: Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
    
18: I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
   
19: Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
    
20: For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
   
21: Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
    
22: This thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
    
23: Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
      
24: Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
    
25: Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
     
26: Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
   
27: Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
    
28: And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.Main Point 1: David prays to God for deliverance from his enemies.

1. Protector: The Psalm portrays mighty God as the protector of His people. It can be seen in verses like Psalm 35:1-3, where David pleads with God to contend his cause against those who strive against him and fight against those who fight against him, showing God's protective nature.

2. Avenger: God is also depicted as the avenger of those who have been wronged. David asks God to recompense the wicked for their deeds and bring them to their downfall (Psalm 35:4-6). This account reflects God's justice, fairness, and His anger against wickedness and injustice.

3. Deliverer: Psalm 35 reaffirms God as a deliverer. In verses 17-18, David asks God to deliver his soul from their destructive plans. This shows God's capacity as a deliverer, rescuing His followers from their enemies and trouble.

4. Provider: The Psalm refers to God as a provider who cares for His children's needs. In verse 10, the Psalmist proclaims his trust in God, who provides deliverance for the poor and needy. God is shown as providing comfort, protection, and everything that His people require for their survival and well-being.

5. Righteous Judge: In verse 23-24, David calls upon God to judge righteousness. This means God is a Righteous Judge who is completely fair and just, and does not show impartiality. He gives everyone their due - be it punishment for the wicked or reward for the righteous.

6. Sovereign: Sovereignty is another one of God's attributes portrayed in this Psalm. God is shown as holding absolute power and authority over all His creation (Psalm 35:10). He uses this authority with wisdom and love, commanding the ultimate respect from all creation.

The similarities emerge in the way every attribute described above consistently portrays God as an omnipotent and just figure. Whether showing Him as protector, avenger, deliverer, provider, righteous judge, or sovereign, all attributes emphasize God's immense power and supreme authority, His unconditional love and care for His people, His perfect justice, and His righteous anger against wickedness. Thus, throughout Psalm 35, God is shown as a moral, caring, powerful, and righteous deity who oversees His creation with unparalleled wisdom and authority.Psalm 35 is a plea by David to God for deliverance from his enemies. There are several connections and parallels that can be drawn between the teachings and person of Jesus Christ and His Apostles and the themes found in this Psalm.

1. Jesus Christ as a persecuted innocent: In Psalm 35, David laments about his persecution despite his innocent actions. This resonates with the life of Jesus Christ, who was also persecuted and crucified despite doing no wrong. For instance, Jesus says in John 15:25 (NIV), "But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'"

2. The theme of betrayal: Psalm 35: 12-14 talks about David being betrayed by those he cared for and loved. Jesus Christ, too, was betrayed by one of his own, Judas Iscariot (Matthew 26:14-16).

3. The theme of the final victory of justice: Psalm 35 speaks about the eventual triumph of the righteous over their adversaries. This is reminiscent of Christ and his ultimate victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:57). 

4. Love for enemies: Although David asks for a plea against his enemies, he showed love and care for them when they were ill. He prayed for them as he would for a friend or brother (Psalm 35:13-14). This mirrors Jesus' teaching about loving one's enemies (Matthew 5:44).

5. The theme of deliverance: Psalm 35 ends with David praising God for his deliverance. This is similar to the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Apostles about the deliverance available through faith in Jesus (John 3:16, Acts 4:12).

6. The theme of joy and rejoicing in the Lord: Psalm 35:27 says, “Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication; And let them say continually, “The LORD be magnified, Who delights in the peace of His servant.” This parallels with the teachings of Christ and His apostles as they emphasize joy and peace given by the Lord (John 14:27, Philippians 4:4).

Nonetheless, it's essential to remember that the Psalms were written in a different context. Reading them through the lens of the teachings of Jesus and His apostles reveals new layers of understanding, but these must always be grounded in a careful interpretation of the texts within their respective historical and literary contexts.There are no Psalms that are completely identical to Psalm 35. However, there are several Psalms which display similar themes, language choices, and imprecatory tones. Below are some of the Psalms displaying such resemblances:

1. Psalm 7: Similar to Psalm 35, Psalm 7 is a plea for divine intervention against the speaker's enemies. The psalmist turns to God for deliverance and justice, asserting his innocence against those who seek to harm him.

2. Psalm 69: Similar themes of persecution, pleas for deliverance, and imprecatory prayer against enemies are evident in this Psalm. The psalmist's cry for vindication and his innocence is common in both psalms, as is the theme of humiliation and shame heaped upon the enemies.

3. Psalm 109: "Put a wicked person over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand," - this imprecation found in Psalm 109:6 echoes the sentiments found in Psalm 35. Both speak of false accusations and refer to the enemies' destruction.

4. Psalm 31: The psalmist pleads to the Lord for deliverance from his enemies - quite like the theme in Psalm 35. People trust in God's righteousness and take refuge in him against the plots of the enemies.

5. Psalm 71: In this Psalm, the psalmist against seeks the Lord to deliver him from the wicked and unjust just like Psalm 35.

6. Psalm 40: This Psalm shares the theme of waiting on the Lord's salvation, expressing hope amidst adversity. Like Psalm 35, it also talks about God's deliverance and the psalmist’s hope and trust in God.
