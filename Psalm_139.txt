1. O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
2. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
3. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
5. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.

7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.

19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
21. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.Main Point 1: God's Complete Knowledge and Understanding (Verses 1-6)

These attributes could be categorized into four major themes: God as omniscient, God as omnipresent, God as omnipotent, and God as a loving Creator.

1. Omniscient (All-knowing): Verses 1-6 of Psalm 139 portrays God as omniscient, that is, knowing everything - our actions, thoughts, and words before we speak them. This attribute is profoundly acknowledged when the psalmist says, "You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar." (v.2)

2. Omnipresent (Everywhere Present): Verses 7-12 expresses God's omnipresence attribute. It means God is available everywhere and there is no place to hide from Him. David, the Psalmist, mentions that even if he ascends to the heavens or makes his bed in the depths, He is there. Whether he rises on the wings of the dawn or settles on the far side of the sea, even there God's hand will guide him. 

3. Omnipotent (All-powerful): Verses 13-18 suggests God's omnipotence. God is portrayed as the creator who knit the psalmist together in his mother's womb, an activity that denotes an all-powerful God capable of molding us according to His plan.

4. God as a Loving Creator: The psalmist in verse 14 acknowledges this attribute by recognizing that he is "fearfully and wonderfully made," showcasing the intricate and loving attention to detail applied by God in Creation. This goes beyond mere ability to a personal, loving act of crafting every individual.

Comparatively, all these four themes in Psalm 139 showcase an intimate and active God, who is not only all-knowing, ever-present, and all-powerful but also a loving creator who intricately crafts and values every individual. Being omniscient, He has complete knowledge of our lives, attesting that our lives are not random or meaningless, but purposefully designed. Through His omnipresence, He assures constant companionship and guidance no matter where we are. His omnipotence is a substantial reassurance of our protection and help in all circumstances. Further, through His divine attribute of love, He creates, values, and sustains us with a profound intention. 

Thus, this understanding of God from Psalm 139 fosters a deep sense of reverence, worth, dependence, relational intimacy, and overall security in the believer's life while dealing with the God of the Universe.Psalm 139 speaks about God’s omnipresence, omniscience, and his meticulous creation of individual human beings. Drawn connections can be established between this Psalm, Jesus, and His apostles in terms of divine insight, individual care, and loving nature depicted throughout various New Testament testimonies.

1) God’s Omniscience, Omnipresence, & Total Care:
Psalm 139:1-6, 7-12 acknowledges God's omniscience and omnipresence, i.e., He knows everything about us whether we sit or rise, He discerns our thoughts from afar, and He hems us in, behind and before. Simply put, there's nowhere we can go where God isn't already there. 

This connection can be found in Jesus’s teachings and interactions with His Apostles. John 1:47-48 depicts Jesus seeing Nathanael sitting under a fig tree before Philip called him – a testament to Christ's divine omniscience. In Matthew 28:20, Jesus also reassures His disciples of His constant spiritual presence, stating, “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

2) God as the Creator:
Psalm 139:13-16 praises God for His hand in the formation of the individual in the womb, underlining God's role as the creator and designer of life. 

This aligns with Christ’s words in Matthew 10:29-31 where He talks about God’s intimate knowledge and value of every single human being. Jesus emphasizes, "And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows."

3) God’s Unfailing Love & Desire for Righteousness:
Psalm 139:23-24 is a plea for God to search, know, test, and see if there's any offensive way in the individual, leading them in the everlasting way. 

This aligns with the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles about God’s desire for a clean heart within us (Matthew 5:8) and aligning our will with His for righteousness sake. In Jesus's high priestly prayer in John 17, He prays for His disciples (including His apostles), asking that His Father sanctify them in truth: “Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.” (John 17:17)

The Apostles, in their letters, also emphasize the need for personal righteousness and purity. Apostle Paul wrote in Romans 12:2, "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing, and perfect will.”

4) God’s Plan & Guidance:
Even in the darkness, God's hand leads us, and His right hand holds us fast (Psalm 139:10). This echos Jesus's claim in John 8:12, where He states, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

Through these connections, it is apparent that the character and teachings of Jesus and His Apostles reverberate with the themes shown in Psalm 139. Their words testify to the nature of a God who is all-knowing, always present, intimately involved in our lives, and striving for individual righteousness.While nothing is perfectly identical to Psalm 139 as each Psalm has its own uniqueness, there are several that do express similar themes. Here are few of them along with the similarities:

1. Psalm 19: This Psalm expresses similar themes of God's knowledge and presence. While Psalm 139 focuses on the individual, Psalm 19 recognizes the omnipresence and omniscience of God in nature and law.

2. Psalm 33: Similar to Psalm 139, it praises God's omniscience and providential control in verses 13-15. It also emphasizes that God formed human heart, like Psalm 139 does, which highlights God's personal involvement in human creation.

3. Psalm 104: This Psalm, like Psalm 139, recognizes God's presence throughout creation and in individuals' lives.

4. Psalm 147: Like Psalm 139, it recognizes God's omniscience by asserting that God knows the number of stars and the names of each. This suggests a similar in-depth understanding of the individual as is recognized in Psalm 139.

Note that although these psalms share similar themes with Psalm 139 such as the inescapability of God's presence, His intimate knowledge of the individual, and His involvement in creation, none of them are literally identical in the way they express these themes. Furthermore, Psalms often overlap in themes due to the nature of their subject matter. It would be inaccurate to suggest that these psalms are, as a whole, identical to Psalm 139, but they do contain similar elements that evoke comparable theological insights.As an AI, I need more specific data to provide useful responses.
